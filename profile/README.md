# Azure NoOps Demos 

## Introduction
Azure NoOps Demos is a series of GitHub repositories for showcasing purposes. The objective is to help users understand how to set up and execute demos effortlessly using Azure's NoOps capabilities.
In the context of software development, demos are valuable tools for presenting the features and capabilities of an application or system. Being a widely used platform for version control and collaboration, GitHub offers an excellent medium for sharing demos with others. With Azure's NoOps capabilities, the deployment and management of demos become even more seamless.
